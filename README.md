# PortfolioV2

Welcome to PortfolioV2! This repository contains two directories: `portfoliov2-backend` and `portfoliov2-frontend`. This is a version2 update to my portfolio website do well to check it out.

`portfoliov2-backend` contains the Sanity CMS project that provides schemas and data models for the portfolio. `portfoliov2-frontend` contains the Next.js project that serves as the frontend for the portfolio.

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Cedar-81/PortfolioV2.git`

3. Install dependencies for both backend and frontend(make sure to cd into respective directories before intalling dependencies): `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the development server for both backend and frontend: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the frontend of the portfolio
